Hello! Based on your current program (CSE) at KTU under the 2019 scheme for Semester 5, I see you are eager to prepare for upcoming exams. The schedule is usually posted by department early each semester, but here's a general timeline: midterms often occur in December and finals towards May-June end of spring break if it’s not already announced. Please check your university'selocal notice board or email for the precise dates as they can vary from year to year. Remember, time management is key! Good luck with your studies, I am here should you need further assistance in preparing study guides or tips on effective studying strategies.
